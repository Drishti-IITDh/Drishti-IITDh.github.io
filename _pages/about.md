**Drishti** is the official student media body of IIT Dharwad. We are a group of students who are passionate about writing, photography, videography, and design. We strive to make it easy for students to express themselves and showcase their talents as well as provide a platform for students to voice their opinions and concerns.

Established in early 2023, Drishti replaced the former unofficial student media body "Volkstimme". With the transtion came a complete rebranding of the media body, with a new logo and a new website. However, the core values of the media body remained the same, to educate, involve, and empower students through journalism.
