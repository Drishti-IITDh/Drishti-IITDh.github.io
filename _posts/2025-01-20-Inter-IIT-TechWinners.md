### General Experience & Emotions

**1.What was your reaction when you realized you had secured 3rd rank? And can you share some memorable moments from the event?**

Initially, we were told that we had secured the 2nd position and won silver. The excitement was overwhelming—we were outside when we got the news, and we literally screamed on the streets of Bombay in sheer joy. It was such a jolly and unforgettable moment for all of us.

Later, during the convocation in the hall, the people sitting in front of us were from IIT Guwahati. When our name was announced, I heard some of them say out loud, "IIT Dharwad?"- it felt surreal to see our institute getting recognition on such a stage.

However, when we were informed that there was an error and we had actually secured 3rd place instead of 2nd, it was really disappointing. It was a tough pill to swallow, but we realized there was nothing we could do to change it. While the initial disappointment lingered, the entire experience- from the high of screaming on the streets to representing IIT Dharwad on such a platform- was still incredibly memorable.

**2.How was your overall experience at IIT Bombay beyond the technical aspects and problem-solving tasks?**

Bombay was a mixed bag. While the campus itself was impressive, the organizing team left a lot to be desired- everything was delayed, which was frustrating at times.

That said, roaming around the campus was a delightful experience. We got to see what a proper library looks like, visited the beautiful Powai Lake, and explored an actual sports ground, which was quite refreshing.

On a personal level, the trip was fruitful in terms of making new friends and connections. Beyond the technical aspects, it was these moments of exploration and camaraderie that made the experience overall pretty decent and memorable.

### Team Formation & Preparation

**3.How did the team come together? Did you already know each other, or was it a new collaboration?**

The team formation happened quite late, but it all came together thanks to Agrim Bhaiya, who brought us together. Richa and Shreya were the first to join the team, followed by Aniruddh and Dev. Later, Ahemad and Prakriti joined, and they turned out to be a great help to the team.

Dev, Richa, Shreya, and Aniruddh knew each other as they are all part of the **Space and Data Science Club at IIT Dharwad**, where Dev is the Junior Secretary.

**4.How did you manage teamwork and distribute responsibilities effectively?**

We had regular team meetings, which ensured everyone stayed aligned, and the eagerness to work and learn played a crucial role in our progress. Everyone was cooperative, which made the overall experience smooth and enjoyable.

**5.How did you manage your academic commitments along with preparing for the Tech Meet?**

Some of us didn't give up on our studies and performed well, but it was really hectic to manage both at a time.

We had a few meetings before the end sems, and after the end sems without wasting a single day, we dived straight into exploring the different ideas that we had discussed before the end sems.

During the end sems we didn't hold any meetings so everyone could focus on the exams.

### Technical Insights

**6.Can you tell us about the project/problem statement that you worked on? What made it unique or challenging? What were the key skills you learned while working on this project?**

The problem statement revolved around image classification and explanation generation. Aniruddh, Prakriti, and Shreya focused on the first task, while Ahemad, Richa, and Dev took on the second task. The goal was to determine whether an image was AI-generated or real, and if it was AI-generated, to explain the reasons behind that classification.

What made the problem unique and challenging was the dataset. We were working with extremely small 32x32 images, which lacked sufficient detail, making it harder to classify accurately. On top of that, adversarial training was required to improve the model's robustness.

Generating meaningful explanations for why an image was AI-generated posed another significant challenge, as it required deeper understanding and interpretation of the image. We tried to balance the trade off of the size and accuracy of the model and made it run on mobile phone, which gave us an edge over the other IITs.

Through this project, we learned about several advanced concepts, including multimodal models, super-resolution techniques, and how frequency plays a critical role in image classification.

Teamwork, effective communication, time management and public speaking were some of the skills we honed through this experience.

**7.Did you face any unexpected technical hurdles during the competition? If so, how did you overcome them?**

We had been given images of 32x32 which makes even humans go crazy to differentiate between AI generated and real, we came up with unique methods like using wavelet transforms for detection and upscaling image with models like edsr which was the unique point of our approach and gave us an upper hand. We faced power cuts when we were making our presentation and we had to work under flashlights of our almost drained phones with no internet.

**8.Were you aware about the topics for the PS beforehand?**

Some of us hadn't used CNN models before, so this was the first time working with them. We learned how the model functions and gained hands-on experience. We also explored transformers during this project. Although some of us had a rough idea about them beforehand, this experience allowed us to delve deeper into their workings and applications.

Overall, it was a great learning experience that expanded our understanding of these topics significantly.

### Competition & Performance

**9.Did you feel any pressure competing against older and more established IITs? How did you handle it?**

We expected to make it to the top 10 because we had worked really hard on this PS, but we never imagined outperforming giants like IIT Bombay and IIT Madras.

We had to compete with experienced people, even the Mtechs and PHDs of tier 1 IITs, but we stood on the podium firmly with no expectations of winning , just one thought in our minds which was ‘presenting well such that it justifies all the hard work and sleepless nights we had spent . Our approach was simple: we focused on working hard and maximizing our efforts rather than worrying about the competition with other IITs.

By staying committed to what we could do and giving our absolute best, we managed to deliver a performance that we’re truly proud of.

**10.Do you see your project having a real-world impact? If yes, how?**

The world is rapidly being transformed by AI, with numerous AI-generated edits and content already appearing highly realistic. As this realism improves, distinguishing between AI-generated and real-world visuals becomes critically important for ethical reasons. For instance, it helps prevent misinformation, safeguard authenticity in fields like journalism and law, and ensure transparency in AI usage. Our project addresses these challenges by not only detecting AI-generated images but also providing explanations, which is essential for building trust and understanding in AI systems.

### Future Prospects & Message to Juniors

**11.What advice would you give to students who wish to participate in future Inter-IIT Tech Meets?**

To excel in future Inter-IIT Tech Meets, start preparing early and build a strong foundation in your area of interest. Focus on teamwork, with each member contributing complementary skills, and always apply theoretical knowledge practically. Stay updated with the latest tech trends, hone your problem-solving and coding skills, and work on effectively communicating your ideas.

Networking with peers and collaborating across disciplines will also provide valuable insights and growth. Look for what the company needs and target that thing. Keep participating in all sorts of competitions to gain experience, the mistakes made and the lessons learnt might prove to be helpful in inter IIT.

**12.What kind of support would you like to see from the institute to improve future performances?**

We deeply appreciate the support and opportunities the institute provides and we are grateful, The institute and the professors played a significant role in our performance. That said, a few improvements could make the experience even better for future teams.

One major challenge we faced was the prolonged power cut, which lasted over 24 hours during critical moments.On the final day, we had to rely on phone flashlights to prepare our presentations, which was far from ideal. Reliable power backup is essential to ensure teams can work efficiently without unnecessary stress, especially when deadlines are tight.

Additionally, providing a sleeper bus for long journeys would help the team rest and arrive energized. Ensuring adequate resources, like well-stocked canteens, would also be great—our current one ran out of snacks during the event prep. Lastly, access to hot water in cold weather would definitely add to everyone’s comfort.

Addressing these small but significant issues would go a long way in helping teams focus better and perform at their best.
