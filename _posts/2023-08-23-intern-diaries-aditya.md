## Introduction
Hey everyone, I am Aditya Kalyani, a final year in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Dharwad. I am from a nearby city Hubli. 

Firstly speaking about my internship in the summers of 2023, at Texas Instruments, to put it in simple words was amiable. The journey began in May 2023 and lasted until July 2023. I was situated in the heart of the technical hub of Banglore—an excellent place for work, fun and exposure. 

## Significance of Internships and Industrial Experience
Before dwelling into the details, why is a third year internship considered necessary? Third-year internships in the technical domain are of paramount importance for several reasons. Firstly, they provide students with invaluable real-world applications of the theoretical knowledge they have acquired during their studies. This hands-on experience allows them to bridge the gap between classroom learning and practical implementation, fostering a deeper understanding of their field. Secondly, these internships offer a platform for honing essential technical skills, enhancing problem-solving abilities, and gaining proficiency in industry-relevant tools and technologies. Lastly, such internships provide a unique opportunity for students to network with professionals, gain insights into industry trends, and potentially open doors to future job opportunities

## Dynamic Selection and Interview Experience 
How was the selection process?
The selection process was in general a three layer filteraton process. As everywhere the first round was resume shortlisting which most of them cleared through. The second round was a technical + aptitude written test. So the technical was further divided into 2 domains namely, Analog and Digital. I applied only for the Analog domain, following my interest but both can be applied for. Further, a few people were shortlisted in both domains. So came the final level of filtration, the interview.
The interview process is very dynamic at TI, as it tests your overall understanding and behaviour along with your technical background. A confident but simplistic answer with a firm hold on the basics and a very ‘want to learn’ attitude helps get through the process. I faced a single round of interviews, whereas some of my friends had multiple rounds. 

## Stepping into the Realm of Texas Instruments
How was it once I was at TI?
The overall experience at Texas Instruments was a cherishable one. A lot to learn from very dynamic, hard-working but friendly and helpful folks. I joined as an Analog Intern but the work needed a good understanding of the digital domain and a good amount of coding, which I was practically very bad at!
As the work started, I learn a bit of coding necessary, some understanding in what I had to further work upon and more of the industrial work culture. 
I built a tool names SPEDIG (SPEctre-based timing check for hand-crafted DIGital). This was a new plan there at TI to my manager, looking at the problems in the industry, which lead the guys at TI to spend a lot of time and money figuring it out. So as the problem was identified, I was there trying to figure out a solution. The tool figures out if there are any timing checks in the Analog heavy circuitry containing a handful of hand-crafted digital components. Not speaking much of the technical details about how it was built and further details (which I am not supposed to reveal!!), The tool was built to a reasonable level, where it is ready to be deployed and readily modifiable for the future. 

## Fostering Growth in a Supportive Team Environment
Apart from the technical work, I was working with a very dynamic and open-minded team, which is very less expectable to get. I bugged my manager and mentor multiple times every single day, despite having a fixed schedule for the meets. This is what benefitted me the most. It ensured that I wasn’t wasting my time stuck on a problem. As many times, neither my mentor nor manager had a solution, they were very supportive and helped me reach out to many folks in the Dallas team in the USA. Bugging those guys in the night was a very informative process. Learned a lot about how the culture works there, simultaneously bullying some people while playing chess with them!

## Learning Beyond Academia
Apart from that, the best part of my team, I was never restricted from attending any meetings, which never was in the jurisdiction of an intern. My mentor always encouraged me to attend multiple, group, and team meetings specifically meant to discuss the development happening in the company including quarterly meetings where all the business of the circle is discussed. 

The work in industry is very different from that in any institution. I had significant exposure to the work atmosphere and some good fun events with the complete team (pizzas and cakes being the most crucial part). 

## Preparation and Attitude
What do I personally recommend before getting in?
Focus on your basics. Always know what you speak, especially in the interviews. Every sentence you speak is questioned. So, have a good grasp of what you have worked so far. Be confident while you speak and always showcase a learning attitude during the process. 

## My Experience and Concluding Remarks
#### So what after you enter a company?
Try out everything you want to. Question every bit of work you do or hear. Learning technical work in the company is a tiny part. Attend, every possible discussion. They teach you the most. Make good contacts, build a friendly relationship and most importantly be ready to learn from every opportunity. This might take you to bug folks occasionally, sometimes late at night, but respecting their time always do it. 
Apart from the work time, enjoy the place, roam about, and learn about the surroundings but yeah only after completing the assigned work. 


#### What am I planning to do later? 
Frankly, I don't know. After a good experience at TI, I loved the work environment there hence, I accepted their offer. TI would be an excellent place for me to start my career. Also, I plan to follow my passion for playing chess sideways, which is encouraged at Texas Instruments.

So yeah that’s my two-month journey at Texas Instruments. 

Feel free to reach out in case you have any questions. All the very best!!
