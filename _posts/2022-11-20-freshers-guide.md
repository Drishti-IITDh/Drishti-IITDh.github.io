# Academics
**Semester Performance Index (SPI)** is used to measure your overall semester performance. SPI is calculated for every semester and is a credit-weighted average of your grade points from the courses you took that semester. In short, your higher credit course grades contribute more to the SPI. Credits for a course are equal to the number of hours you are expected to spend on it every week (including class hours). **Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)** is similar to SPI but calculated over all semesters. CPI is our equivalent to CGPAs used in other institutes.

| Grades | Points |            
| ------ | ------ |
|AA    |10     |
|AB    |9      |
|BB    |8      |
|BC    |7      |
|CC    |6      |
|CD    |5      |
|DD    |4     |

> For the challenge takers out there, there is, in fact, a grade higher than an AA! Students who perform exceptionally well in a course may be awarded a special **AP grade**. However, AP and AA have the same grade point, i.e. 10.


# Branch Change
Students are eligible to apply for a change of branch/Programme after completing the first semester and before the start of the second semester. All branch transfers can be effected only once at the beginning of the second semester.
1. The Eligibility Criteria for applying for a change of branch/Programme are:
a. **Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first semester**
b. **No backlog at the end of the first semester**
2. Before beginning the allocation, additional seats are made available in each branch, limited to a **maximum of 20% of its sanctioned strength**.
3. While students are allotted seats of general and reserved type during admission, this data is not used during branch change. **Each available seat may be occupied by students of any category**.
4. An eligible student's request for a shift from branch 𝐴 to branch 𝐵 will be considered valid if the following criteria are satisfied.
 a. There is a seat available in Branch 𝐵
 b. The strength in branch 𝐴, from which a change is being sought, does not fall below its sanctioned strength by more than 20%.

Among all valid requests, a student with the highest CPI is chosen, and a branch/program is changed. The process is continued till the seats are filled, or all valid applications are considered. In case of a tie, the person with a higher JEE (Advanced) rank will be given the allotment.
