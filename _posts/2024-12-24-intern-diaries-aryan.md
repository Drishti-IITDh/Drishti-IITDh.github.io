### Introduction

Hello, I am Aryan Gupta, a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate. This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a **research intern** at Ontario Tech University, Canada, under the prestigious **MITACS Globalink Research Internship program**. My project title was **"Detection of Trace Concentrations of Cannabinoids by Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy"**. The title might sound heavy with scientific terminology, but the project work was primarily based on **machine learning** applications. Although science and research is not my domain, I was more excited to explore Canada, experience how things work in institutions outside India, and gain insights into research culture abroad.


#### What is MITACS GRI?

The **MITACS Globalink Research Internship (GRI)** is a program that provides 12-week research opportunities in Canada, allowing undergraduate students from partner countries to collaborate with **leading faculty** across diverse fields, including science, engineering, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences. Interns work in Canadian institutions under the supervision of their professors. The program offers around **8500 CAD** to cover expenses, making it a well-supported opportunity. Unfortunately, for 2025, India has been excluded from the program due to financial constraints, though there’s hope it may reopen to Indian students in the future.


#### Application Procedure

The application process for the internship was straightforward but required careful preparation:

1. You need to submit your **academic transcript, resume, and two Letters of Recommendation (LORs)**.

2. You are allowed to choose up to **seven projects**, and I shortlisted **three** in Speech Processing and Machine Learning, **two** in Data Science, and **two** related to Raman Spectra.

3. I’m grateful to Prof. Surya Pratap Singh, who gave me an LOR and helped me select projects related to **Raman spectroscopy** from the long list available.

4. Once you apply, professors **review your profile**, and if your background aligns with their project, they may call you for an interview.

If selected after the interview, you are matched to a project. MITACS supports you throughout the process, from **guiding visa applications to booking flights**. However, you need to initially pay for flights and other expenses, which MITACS reimburses once you arrive in Canada.


##### My Experience

During my internship, I worked with datasets containing **molecules** and their vibrational spectra, aiming to find the relationship between molecular structures and their spectra. To achieve this, I created an end-to-end pipeline in Python, leveraging techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction, **DBSCAN clustering** for pattern recognition, and **regressors** such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor (DT), and Random Forest Regressor (RF) for predictive modeling. Most of my work was **computer-based**, and I had weekly meetings with my professor and lab mates to discuss progress. The professors and research scholars were very supportive, always ready to help if I encountered challenges. Weekends were free, giving me the chance to explore Canada and experience its **culture and natural beauty**. My primary deliverable was a detailed report in **research paper format and codes**, though deliverables may vary depending on the professor’s requirements.


##### Suggestions for Juniors

If you’re planning to apply for international internships like MITACS, here are a few tips based on my experience. **Securing projects** in fields like machine learning, AI, or deep learning can be challenging without prior experience or research papers in similar areas. When applying, make sure your resume **highlights** any work you’ve done that aligns with the project you’re targeting. Additionally, don’t focus solely on big or complex projects— include smaller, manageable ones that **match your expertise**, as this can significantly boost your chances. Keep an eye on other **international internship opportunities** such as SURF Stanford, SURF Caltech, CERN, DAAD WISE, Charpak Lab, Berkeley SUPERB USA, etc. 


Wishing you all the success in your journey ahead!
