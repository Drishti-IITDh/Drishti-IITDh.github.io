#### Introduction

Hello, I am Abhiram K, a 4th year Engineering Physics Undergraduate. I am an aspiring astrophysicist with a passion for transient and time domain astronomy, particularly interested in Supernova (SN), Fast Radio Bursts(FRBs), and Tidal Disruption Events(TDEs). I was privileged
to work at Caltech as a summer intern through the **Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)** program.

#### What is SURF at Caltech?

The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program at Caltech allows undergraduate students to engage in hands-on, cutting-edge research under the mentorship of Caltech faculty or JPL scientists. Spanning 10 weeks during the summer, SURF emphasizes **independent project design, rigorous experimentation, and scientific communication**, allowing students to contribute meaningfully to active research.

#### Motivation

Since high school, I have been interested in physics, spending hours pointing the telescope at the night sky. I further explored various fields in physics, such as astronomy, experimental condensed matter physics, quantum semiconductors, and quantum information, until my junior
year. I was very much intrigued by stellar death and transient astronomy. The brilliant **cosmic explosion**, sometimes outshining the whole galaxy with billions of stars, made me curious. To further my research goals and expand my horizons, an internship at Caltech can be enriching. This motivated me to apply for SURF at Caltech.

#### Preparation Strategies and Application Procedures

The **SURF application** process typically begins in November of the year before the internship, with the deadline usually falling in mid-February. An essential criterion for selection is identifying
a research problem and proposing a unique and specific idea that can be feasibly executed during the summer term at Caltech. A well-defined and innovative proposal significantly enhances the chances of selection.

There are two main ways to secure a SURF opportunity. First, you can explore the "Announcement of Opportunities" section on the Caltech SURF page. While most listed opportunities are for Caltech students, some projects may be open to both Caltech and non-Caltech students, allowing international applicants to apply. Second, you can directly approach a professor with your research proposal. This often involves a selection process, which may include tasks or interviews. Once selected and the project is finalized, you can complete the SURF application. 

**Strong recommendation letters** from professors are crucial for a successful application. Building strong connections with professors and gaining prior research experience through projects significantly boosts your chances. Early preparation is vital; students should identify their niche
and build a focused research profile to demonstrate evident expertise. Publications, while not mandatory, greatly enhance your application and showcase your commitment to research. 

Finally, some professors and research scientists also evaluate your academic background,
including grades and course selections. For example, if you are looking for a project in Astronomy and Astrophysics, a **good grade** in the course, for instance, in Astrophysics, can be very convincing for the professor to guide you on a project related to Astrophysics and Astronomy.

#### Journey and Experience

Traveling abroad can be a new experience, often filled with joy and anxiety. However, the SURF program at Caltech ensures a smooth and enriching experience by providing **ample resources and support** throughout your journey. From assisting with visa processes and accommodation to offering guidance on navigating life in Pasadena, the program is designed to help you focus on your research while enjoying your time in the U.S. At Caltech, I was working on the ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS), where I worked on the spectral classification of Supernova and identifying rare SN subtypes. My SURF experience was further elevated by working on the **iconic 200-inch Hale Telescope** at Palomar Observatory, contributing to groundbreaking supernova research. I presented my progress to the group every week. Further, I also used to present my progress to the ZTF community worldwide bi-weekly. I also had the chance to visit the historic Mount Wilson Observatory and the Griffith Observatory, soaking in their rich astronomical legacy. There are **weekly talks and seminars** by Caltech professors. Additionally, the SURF office organizes weekly trips to nearby places. I experienced the vibrant energy of Los Angeles, from its bustling streets to its beautiful beaches, making the journey as memorable personally as it was professionally. I visited several places to explore the diverse cuisines. 

Overall, it was a great research experience and an excellent opportunity to expand oneâ€™s horizons.

Thank you and best of luck to everyone ready to delve into everything astro!
