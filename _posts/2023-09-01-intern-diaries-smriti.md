## About me:  
I've always been intrigued by the **dynamic world of wireless technology**. My journey into
research was born out of a **desire to explore the uncharted territories at the intersection of
technology and academia**. Throughout my bachelors, I've delved deep into research projects
focusing on wireless communications, IoT, Radar Technology, etc. My passion for this field has
driven me to publish three conference papers in esteemed international conferences like
**GLOBECOMM**, **WCNC** etc, and a journal in the **IEEE Internet of Things Journal**. In my second
year summer, I interned at the **New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)** where I worked on **Joint
Radar and Communication Systems**.



## The Application Process:  
Since I’ve been invested in research right from my third semester, I was already aware of
international research fellowships like **MITACS**, **DAAD**, **Charpak**, etc.
The application process for MITACS Internship is quite straightforward. Their **Globalink
Research Internship (GRI)** website provided all the necessary details and prerequisites. As part
of the application, I submitted *my academic transcript, 2 letters of recommendation, resume,
and other required documents*. The project selection process involved **choosing a maximum of 7
projects from a sea of projects offered, ones that align with your field and research experience**.
After submitting my application, I awaited responses from project professors, and was fortunate
enough to be selected for my first preference project after a brief interview by the professor.



## Research Topic:  
My project was based on **Software Defined Radios and their application in Intelligent
Transportation and Satellite Communications**.I was tasked with building and deploying a **Doppler shifter based Channel Emulator** and a **m-sequence Channel Sounder using the ADALM-PLUTO SDR**. This hands-on project allowed
me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications.



## My Team:  
I worked as a part of the Radio Science Lab Team, led by Professor *David Michelson*. Highly
esteemed in the field, Dr. Michelson is himself an alumnus of UBC and serves as the Director of
the **AURORA Connected Vehicle Testbed initiative of Canada**. My team included a few other Masters and PhD students and another international intern from Italy. The group worked on various projects ranging from **Satellite Communications**, **V2X Hub**, **Naval Measurements**, etc.



## The Experience:
This summer was an incredible turning point in my life and truly a transformative journey. This
project was my first preference not just due to the interesting topic, but because UBC, one of the
top 3 universities in Canada, was located in the **picturesque city of Vancouver** – where city
meets mountains meets ocean. I had a fascinating group of friends from Germany, France,
Mexico, Hong Kong, UK, etc. So while I worked hard on my project, I balanced that with
numerous activities like sunsets at the beach, Kayaking, hiking, club-hopping, weekend trips,
concerts, etc. Surrounded by forests on three sides and the Pacific ocean on the fourth, **the
UBC campus was a mini-universe in itself**. A highlight for me was visiting **TRIUMF, Canada’s
particle accelerator**, which was located on campus.
On a professional note, the internship proved to be highly enriching. During this time, I actively
participated in the coordination of the **EMTS International Conference**, an event for which my
advisor, Dr. Michelson, served as the Chair. This provided me with invaluable networking
prospects, enabling me to connect with esteemed professors from renowned institutions such
as Purdue, UT Austin, and UCSD. Moreover, I had the **privilege of interacting with accomplished
scientists, as well as high-ranking executives including vice presidents and directors hailing from
prominent companies like Altair, Intel, and HP**.



## Future Plans: 
Currently, I am continuing my collaboration with UBC through a Co-op project. I am also working
on a research paper based on our abstract which was accepted at the **Intelligent Transportation
Systems Conference**. In my final semester, I will be working at **NUS (National University of
Singapore)** on a research project as a part of the **WEISER group**. My future plans include
pursuing a masters, or perhaps a PhD at one of the universities in the United States.


So that's all about my exciting journey as a research intern.  
Thank you and all the very best!
