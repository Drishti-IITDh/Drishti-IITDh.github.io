## How would you describe your transition from college life to professional life and from being a student to becoming an alumnus?
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a unique journey for me. Coming from an electrical background, I had a strong interest in computer science from the beginning. The pandemic provided me with ample time to prepare for my professional journey, which was beneficial. During my college years, I was actively involved in various extracurricular activities, such as being part of different communities and clubs, including my own initiative called OSS.

While these activities were fulfilling, they often consumed a significant amount of my time, leaving me with limited focus on my professional development. However, with the pandemic-induced restrictions, I had the opportunity to dedicate more time to preparing for job placements both on and off campus. Consequently, I was able to secure decent job offers.In summary, my transition from college life to professional life and from being a student to becoming an alumnus was a decent experience considering the circumstances.

## Despite your background in the electrical department, you chose to focus on coding, not solely for the purpose of securing an IT job, but also pursued research as an intern at IISC Bangalore.
Indeed, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at IISC Bangalore, where my involvement centered around a research project. However, my role primarily revolved around development rather than pure research. Specifically, I contributed to a smartwatch project, focusing on cybersecurity aspects. Hence, it would be more accurate to describe my work as development-oriented rather than research-driven.


## How was your experience of building friendships with people from diverse cultural backgrounds across India?
Being actively involved in numerous communities allowed me to gain valuable insights into effective communication, cultural sensitivity, community building, and the establishment of clubs. Given that our college was relatively new and lacked organized activities, engaging with these communities provided me with invaluable knowledge on how to set up similar structures within our college. I learned what criteria these communities sought when establishing connections with other institutions and how to ensure a seamless integration. Starting from ground zero, I was able to successfully scale these to 10, facilitating future growth beyond this.

## If you were to attend college now, would you change anything about your experience?
Given that we were among the pioneering batches, the coding culture was not as prevalent during our time. Consequently, despite having access to numerous opportunities and placements with reputable companies, many students struggled to fully capitalize on them due to a lack of exposure and understanding of essential coding and placement-related skills. If given the chance, I would have endeavored to establish a stronger foundation in these areas. However, I must note that subsequent batches gradually recognized the importance of these skills, as our own batch laid the groundwork for their integration. Although I cannot change the past, I believe there is value in reflecting upon the possibilities for improvement had we possessed the knowledge and resources at the time.

## As one of the first batches in our college, and now as campus ambassadors for our college, you faced various challenges. Particularly, you focused on branding and introducing organizations to our college. Could you elaborate on the challenges you encountered and how you addressed them?
When it comes to any college, establishing a strong brand is crucial. This holds true for both companies and educational institutions. Placement opportunities are often a significant factor for students and their parents when considering a college. Thus, it was important for our college to create a brand that attracts good companies and offers promising placements.

Branding was one of the primary challenges we faced. We aimed to showcase our college as a reputable institution and create a positive image among students and prospective employers. To tackle this challenge, we organized various events and invited students from other colleges. This allowed them to experience our college firsthand and witness the opportunities available. It provided an opportunity to establish a connection and create awareness about our institution beyond just its name.

Additionally, we emphasized community participation and engagement. Encouraging students to actively participate in college events and engage with other communities helped build bonds and contribute to the branding process. By winning events and showcasing our talents, we created a positive impression and gained recognition.

Furthermore, we sought to bridge the gap between our college and external organizations. By organizing events, inviting startups, and facilitating interactions with industry professionals, we aimed to expose students to different perspectives and provide them with real-world insights. This fostered a sense of belonging and also showcased the potential of our college to external entities.

As campus ambassadors, we understand the importance of continued branding efforts. We encourage you, as the new batch at our permanent campus, to actively participate in all college events and engage with various communities. By doing so, you can strengthen bonds, contribute to the college's brand, and build connections with students from other colleges. It is through these collective efforts that we can establish a strong and reputable identity for our college.

## What aspects of college do you miss the most? Could you share some of your positive experiences, including any challenges you faced?
When reminiscing about my college days, there are several memorable experiences that come to mind. One particular highlight was the Parsec event. This event holds a special place in my heart as it encompassed two and a half years of our college journey, excluding the time spent at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It took place in March, just before the pandemic's impact became significant.

We initially had concerns about whether the event would be successful or if external circumstances would hinder it. However, against the odds, we managed to organize Parsec with great success. The event surpassed our expectations, featuring renowned speakers from esteemed companies such as Google and Microsoft. The response we received was overwhelming, and it instilled a sense of pride in our batch.

Parsec was significant not only because it showcased the efforts of our batch, but also because it represented our growth and achievements. Despite being a relatively new batch, we were able to organize an event of such caliber and create an impact. The team behind Parsec worked diligently within a tight timeframe, learning and implementing everything from scratch. We navigated unfamiliar territories, seeking permissions and establishing the necessary departments to bring the event to life.

Parsec became a cherished memory for me and many others from our batch. It served as a testament to our abilities, teamwork, and determination. The event left a lasting impression on us, and I believe that a significant majority of our batch would agree that Parsec remains a milestone in our college journey.

While there may have been challenges along the way, focusing on the positive experiences and milestones like Parsec is what we carry with us throughout our lives.

## As someone who has excelled in technical pursuits, leading our inter-IIT technical team and winning a gold medal in the Schlumberger coding hackathon, you have extensive experience in the technical realm. However, our college currently lacks provisions for technical affairs like other IITs. What message would you like to convey to them?
Being in an IIT, we are part of the Indian Institute of Technology, where technology is at the core of everything we do. Among the various events and fests held in colleges, including sports days and cultural festivals, it is the technical events that provide ample opportunities for participation and growth. Unlike sports or cultural activities, where extensive training, equipment, or specialized skills are often required, technology offers a more accessible platform.

In the realm of technology, one doesn't need a prestigious degree or prior knowledge to excel. Students can enter college without any technical background and, within a short span of one, two, or three years, learn and achieve remarkable things. Technical events serve as platforms where individuals can showcase their talents and skills, regardless of their prior experience or expertise.

For those who may feel hesitant or intimidated by competition in technical events, it's important to note that the learning curve in technology is relatively smooth. Students have the opportunity to acquire knowledge, develop their skills, and perform exceptionally well. Unlike other fields where external factors can significantly impact performance, technology allows individuals to focus on their own growth and progress.

While it's true that sports and cultural activities require external resources, training, and specialized guidance, technology embraces a more inclusive approach. It provides a level playing field for students to enter college with minimal prerequisites and emerge as proficient individuals in their chosen technical domains.

Therefore, I would encourage our college to recognize the significance of technical affairs and create provisions for them. By establishing a platform for technical events, our college can foster an environment where students can explore, learn, and excel in various technological disciplines. Embracing technology not only enhances the reputation of the institution but also provides students with valuable opportunities to enhance their technical skills and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.

## What advice would you give to someone new to the field of technology, and how can they improve to excel in competitions?
The first and foremost advice I would offer is to start early. Starting early is crucial in any field, whether it's sports, music, or technology. By starting early, you gain a head start and have more time to explore and learn. It allows you to discover your interests and develop a strong foundation in technology.

Secondly, I highly recommend building a good rapport with seniors who have gone through similar experiences. They possess valuable knowledge and insights, both positive and negative, which they can share with you. Establishing a bond with them will provide you with guidance and help you avoid common mistakes. Their experiences will give you an advantage and offer a roadmap for your own journey.

If you are specifically interested in technology for the purpose of placements, it is important to start early and explore different areas within the field. It may take some time to determine your specific interests, but the process of exploration should begin early. By the end of your second year, you should have a good understanding of your preferences and areas of focus. This will allow you to target specific technologies or domains and prepare accordingly.

In the long run, as you progress into your professional life, continue to explore and learn. Technology is a vast field with constant advancements, so it is essential to stay updated and adapt to new developments. This ongoing exploration will help you excel in competitions and succeed in the ever-evolving world of technology.

These steps lay the foundation for growth and pave the path to excel in competitions, leading you towards remarkable success in the world of technology.

## As the head of public relations for CDC (Career Development Cell), how did CDC contribute to your placement journey?
From an external perspective, every company seeks a reliable entity to establish professional communication and build strong ties with academic institutions. It is crucial to have a recognized and organized body that serves as a bridge between companies and students. This is where CDC (Career Development Cell) comes into play.

CDC, with its structured framework and involvement of professors and the institute's director, acts as a vital entity in facilitating placement processes and fostering long-term relationships with organizations. It serves as an official body that companies recognize and engage with for recruitment purposes.

Having CDC as the orchestrator of placement activities enables our college to establish enduring connections with organizations. These relationships go beyond mere placements, as they lay the groundwork for future collaborations and partnerships. With CDC's involvement, we can confidently state that our college has collaborations with renowned companies, and potential collaborations in the future.

CDC has played a crucial role in our placement journey by actively engaging with various organizations, organizing placement drives, and providing essential support and guidance to students. The efforts of CDC have significantly contributed to securing placements for many students, which, in turn, enhances the branding and reputation of our college.

In summary, CDC's presence and initiatives have been instrumental in shaping our placement journey. Its recognized status, collaborative approach, and diligent efforts in building relationships with organizations have facilitated successful placements and fostered long-standing connections with the professional world.

## Mental health is highly important. How did college impact your mental and emotional well-being? Did it drain you? Was college mentally challenging for you?
Initially, it was quite a unique experience for me as it was my first time being so far away from home. When it comes to academics, I was fortunate enough not to face an undue burden of pressure. I consciously avoided placing excessive expectations on myself, allowing me to approach my studies with a balanced perspective. Initially, I set ambitious goals, aiming for a high Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) of 10 or 9. However, I soon realized that such exceptional achievements were not feasible for everyone. Consequently, I made the pragmatic decision to strive for an average CPI that would still enable me to secure favorable placements.

Reflecting on my college experience, I must acknowledge that it comprised a diverse range of experiences. There were undoubtedly moments of challenge and difficulty, but it would be inaccurate to categorize the entirety of my journey as mentally draining. Instead, it was a combination of highs and lows, with each experience contributing to my personal growth. In retrospect, the trajectory of my overall experience exhibits a positive trend, characterized by an evolving sense of resilience and emotional well-being.

## Many students prioritize academics over extracurricular activities, seeking advice from seniors and valuing grades. But what advice do you have for struggling students torn between improving their grades or exploring their interests? Should they focus more, endure stress, or go with the flow?
From my own experience, despite striving for good grades in my first year, I didn't succeed. Changing fields is a common consideration, but sometimes not feasible. Instead, I maintained an average performance while exploring personal growth opportunities. After placements, students often seek alternative options. If one has a passion for sports, they should focus on that. Similarly, those with creative inclinations should explore those avenues. Personally, I discovered open-source software as an opportunity for growth. Note that I don't advocate ignoring studies, but keeping options open. The first year is about personal growth and college offers a chance to explore and broaden horizons. The location of Dharwad provides opportunities to visit nearby places, fostering valuable skills like exploration, negotiation, and communication. Small tasks, like booking a hotel, contribute to honing communication skills and more.

## What drove your career transitions from Money View to Zomato, and now to ShareChat? Specifically, considering your primary goals in Software Development Engineering (SDE), what factors influenced your decisions, particularly taking into account the diverse geographic locations of these companies (North, South, and East) that represent distinct directions?
Since my childhood, I have embraced challenges and avoided complacency, always open to new opportunities. Initially, financial considerations were important, but my initial package fell short. Recognizing the potential for improvement, I knew I could secure a better offer with effort.

After college, my preparation efforts didn't bring the desired satisfaction. I secured a backup job on campus while pursuing more promising off-campus opportunities. I sought a reputable brand name, which Money View lacked. Despite others thinking I had a full-time position, I remained open to switching roles.

During that time, Zomato sought new engineers through referrals for a new vertical. I received a call, likely due to my project involvement since my first year. Later, the vertical was acquired by CureFit, giving me choices: stay with Zomato, join CureFit, or explore elsewhere. CureFit's hybrid nature didn't align with my interests, and Zomato's offer was lacking, prompting me to search for external opportunities.

Within a month of joining Zomato, individuals from ShareChat approached me. Although content with my income and brand recognition, I valued having a backup plan. I contacted the recruiter and secured an offer from ShareChat, a dynamic and rapidly growing company. Joining them felt fulfilling and solidified my decision.

I never felt compelled to restrict myself to a single domain or plan for career transitions. Opportunities naturally unfolded, and I found satisfaction in my role at ShareChat.

## In conclusion, would you like to convey a message to the juniors, your batchmates, or express something from your perspective?
To the juniors, I want to convey that we made dedicated efforts to enhance our IIT's reputation during our time. Unfortunately, the impact of COVID-19 disrupted various aspects, resulting in a regrettable lack of knowledge transfer. Nevertheless, we maximized the resources available to us to the best of our abilities. You are fortunate to have a supportive community, well-equipped campus infrastructure, and abundant opportunities. We are here to support you whenever you need assistance or have innovative ideas. Our batchmates and I are approachable and willing to help you overcome any challenges or confusion you may face. Your advantage lies in already having some ideas, which might make your journey relatively smoother compared to ours. As for us, the focus on placements and the constraints imposed by COVID-19 prevented us from fully enjoying our final year of college. However, if presented with another opportunity, we believe it is crucial to seize it and relish the experiences we missed. Rest assured, we are actively working towards that goal.
