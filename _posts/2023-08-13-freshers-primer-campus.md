## Daily Regimen

As the night falls, you diligently set the alarm for 8:20 am, and the reason behind this preparation becomes apparent. The looming specter of the dreaded morning class haunts you once more, and you hold onto the hope that a mere 10 minutes will be enough to get ready. However, you know all too well that a single minute's delay could seal your fate – the classroom gates swiftly closing, leaving you marked absent. With 80% attendance mandatory, every second carries tremendous weight, transforming mornings into a race against time. Even if you miraculously made it to the classroom on time, get ready for the riveting adventure of nodding off during the enthralling lectures that follow. But worry not, for your gallant friends are ever-ready to snap you out of those captivating daydreams, ensuring you don't miss the opportunity to sign the attendance sheet – because what's a lecture without a little mid-slumber attendance ritual, right?

## Classrooms in CLT

Stepping into the Central Learning Theatre (CLT) at IIT is awe-inspiring! The grand amphitheater-like class, with 300 eager minds, makes learning an incredible journey. State-of-the-art infrastructure adds to the excitement, making every lecture captivating. You feel a strong sense of belonging to a community that values education and growth. Welcome to IIT, where every day is an enthralling pursuit of knowledge and excellence!

## DTC Classes

Prepare to release your inner artistic genius and have an absolute riot with your buddies! Introducing our so-called "Design Thinking and Creativity" course, where you'll be handed assignments that supposedly ignite your imagination. Brace yourselves for these mind-bending tasks that might just be the pinnacle of human creative achievement – or not. And oh, did I mention the chance to win prizes that are apparently "attractive" with solutions that are so ingenious they could probably solve world peace? Hold onto your hats because we're about to take you on a ride that's as "exhilarating" as your average Monday morning commute. Get ready for an adventure in "fun" and "innovation" that'll make you question the meaning of "unforgettable experiences." But hey, at least you'll have some stories to tell!

## Lunch Break

Ah, the thrilling lunchtime saga unfolds! Once you escape the enthralling clutches of your riveting class, brace yourself for the grand race to the mess, where the queue rivals the excitement of a roller coaster queue – minus the fun, of course. Because who needs a full 1 hour 30 minutes to enjoy a leisurely lunch? Pff, mere 40 minutes will suffice, and that's just a piece of cake when you have to magically teleport yourself to the lab by 2 pm. Clearly, a task fit for superheroes!

But hold on, brave souls, for in these dire times, the art of queue-scanning becomes your ultimate survival tactic. You'll meticulously scan for a familiar "comrade" – or a face you might have crossed paths with in an alternate universe – anything to secure a spot ahead in the queue. Engage in the fine art of small talk, and voila! You're suddenly a master of queue-fu, expertly sliding ahead. Who knew that intellectual debates on the merits of Paneer could be your secret weapon?

Now, brace yourself for the culinary experience of a lifetime. The food? Well, it's a masterpiece in its own right – maybe not in taste, but surely in the realm of manageability. And let's not forget the pinch of laughter and sprinkling of profound discussions over the mess table – they're practically the seasoning that turns your average meal into a Michelin-star experience. By the time you're done, it's a dramatic race against time, like a low-budget action movie, as you dash to the labs with seconds to spare. Who said lunchtime couldn't be an adrenaline-packed adventure?

## Labs After Lunch

The heart of the Walmi Campus is bustling with labs, and among them, the SP-16 Computer labs shine with their inviting air-conditioned spaces. A relaxed dress code lets you embrace comfort, allowing shorts and chappals as your lab companions. However, a shift to a more formal attire is requisite for the Physics, Hands-on Engineering, and Chemistry labs. Here, lab coats, sturdy shoes, and protective eyewear harmonize for a purposeful ensemble.

Inside these labs, you're in for some really interesting experiences. You'll get to work with things like electron beams, try your hand at tasks like welding, carpentry, and soldering. You might even end up making food for tiny microbial colonies after having a not-so-great lunch. And of course, you'll also be experimenting with chemicals to create things. While some students are coding whizzes and might make others a bit jealous, it's your friends who'll have your back when lab work gets confusing. That's what good friends do, right? ;)

Amidst the treasure trove of IIT-DH labs, the Hands-On Engineering Lab and Engineering Graphics Lab (EGL) carve their niches away from the Walmi hub. In the distant reaches of the academic expanse, EGL beckons, demanding a toolkit brimming with rulers, erasers, and pencils—a symphony of preparation. Navigating through a tapestry of erased pencil marks is the challenge, where mastering AutoCAD nuances becomes an asset. Earning marks here hinges on precision amid the echoes of erased lines, making patience and meticulousness the hallmarks of this exceptional and exacting laboratory journey.

## NSO and Sports in the Evening

The day's busyness seems to never stop. After a satisfyingly busy stretch of labs and lectures, the ever-inviting Sports Ground is ready to welcome you, urging your participation in the impactful activities of the National Sports Organisation (NSO) and National Service Scheme (NSS). And indeed, for those who opt for more active pursuits, they venture towards the specifically designated courts and grounds, where they engage in practice sessions that are intended to be "relaxing" and "leisurely," perhaps as a fitting way to unwind after fulfilling their NSO/NSS commitments. In the unfolding journey towards greatness, it becomes evident that its path is versatile. Students masterfully blend their academic pursuits with equally captivating explorations into the worlds of sports and service.

## After Dinner Stuff

With extracurricular activities behind you, the next challenge awaits - preparing for the upcoming quiz. While some students may prefer studying in the comfort of their room, the constant noise and unending mischiefs can render it an unproductive environment. Therefore, it's time to explore alternative study options, seeking tranquil spots like Common rooms in the hostel where focus and concentration can thrive.

## Midnight

As the day winds down, opting for some much-needed rest in your bed seems like a logical decision. Yet, the allure of gathering with your wingmates in one room is tough to resist. The ambiance becomes vibrant, with conversations spanning from academic challenges to debates regarding movies and sports. For those seeking a different kind of involvement, diving into popular gaming choices such as BGMI, CoD, or ValoRant provides an appealing alternative. The night holds the promise of bonding, laughter, and camaraderie, making it an inviting prospect.

## Late Night

As the night winds down, you crave some late-night Chai or Maggi from the canteen before it closes. Hoping to find contentment in the day's growth and cherished memories, you retreat to bed. The upcoming four years promise a transformative journey, with highs and lows shaping you in unimaginable ways. Beyond infrastructure and academics, the connections you build and spontaneous bulla sessions become the essence of your campus life. Embrace the uncertainties, for they will lead you to self-discovery and a meaningful place at IIT-DH.

## Hostel Companions’ Weekend Retreat

Indulging in games like TT, Carrom, and Chess in the common space on the hostel floors can be a fantastic stress-reliever. It's a wonderful way to unwind and bond with friends. And if you manage to sneak in a game of box cricket without the guards noticing, well, that adds an extra dose of excitement and thrill to the experience! So, let the games begin, and let the worries fade away as you create fun-filled memories in the company of your hostel mates.
Watching IPL and FIFA Finals in the common rooms is an electrifying, unforgettable experience. Cheers, adrenaline, and camaraderie create the best moments with friends. Join the energy, witness sporting history, and cherish the shared emotions. Don't miss this incredible experience!
