description: Academics hold a significant position in the lives of students at IIT Dharwad. In this section, we aim to provide a concise overview of the academic curriculum at IITDh, shedding light on its structure (even if it may appear intricate). Following that, we will delve into a brief exploration of the broader academic environment encompassing the campus.

Each program follows a distinct academic structure guided by its respective departmental curriculum. This curriculum meticulously outlines the courses to be completed in a semester-wise sequence, ensuring that the essential requirements for the specific degree are fulfilled. Moreover, the curriculum takes into account the prerequisites for various courses, facilitating a well-organized course schedule. It's worth noting that while this curriculum serves as a framework, students retain the flexibility to arrange their courses as per their preferences. For more comprehensive insights into the course curriculum, you can refer to the B.Tech. rulebook available on the [IITDh Intranet](https://intranet.iitdh.ac.in:444/pdf/circular/B.%20Tech.%20Rulebook_17Jul23.pdf), we have also made available a copy of it [here](/assets/pdfs/B. Tech. Rulebook_17Jul23.pdf).

## Evaluation Framework

Semester Performance Index (SPI) is used to measure your overall semester performance. SPI is calculated for every semester and is a credit-weighted average of your grade points from the courses you took that semester. In short, your higher credit course grades contribute more to the SPI. Credits for a course are equal to the number of hours you are expected to spend on it every week (including class hours). Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) is similar to SPI but calculated over all semesters. CPI is our equivalent to CGPAs used in other institutes.

| Grades | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
|   AA   |   10   |
|   AB   |   9    |
|   BB   |   8    |
|   BC   |   7    |
|   CC   |   6    |
|   CD   |   5    |
|   DD   |   4    |

For the challenge takers out there, there is, in fact, a grade higher than an AA! Students who perform exceptionally well in a course may be awarded a special AP grade. However, AP and AA have the same grade point, i.e. 10. 

## Branch Change

Students are eligible to apply for a change of branch/Programme after completing the first semester and before the start of the second semester. All branch transfers can be effected only once at the beginning of the second semester.

1. The Eligibility Criteria for applying for a change of branch/Programme are: 
a. **Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first semester.**
b. **No backlog at the end of the first semester.**

2. Before beginning the allocation, additional seats are made available in each branch, limited to a **maximum of 20% of its sanctioned strength.**

3. While students are allotted seats of general and reserved type during admission, this data is not used during branch change. **Each available seat may be occupied by students of any category.**

4. An eligible student’s request for a shift from branch B to branch B will be considered valid if the following criteria are satisfied. a. There is a seat available in Branch B. The strength in branch A , from which a change is being sought, does not fall below its sanctioned strength by more than 20%.

Among all valid requests, a student with the highest CPI is chosen, and a branch/program is changed. The process is continued till the seats are filled, or all valid applications are considered. In case of a tie, the person with a higher JEE (Advanced) rank will be given the allotment.

## Minor Programmes

IIT Dharwad provides students with the exciting opportunity to pursue a minor degree in any of four distinct domains:

1. Minor in AI and Data Science
2. Minor in Energy and Environment
3. Minor in Computer Science
4. Minor in Smart Systems

For those aiming to attain a minor in any of these specialized fields, the requirement entails accumulating a total of 30 credits. This encompasses a blend of mandatory courses and elective selections offered within the chosen minor domain. This condition stands in addition to fulfilling the minimum credit prerequisites essential for their primary degree.

The detailed rules and procedures regarding the academic curriculum including information on branch change, minor, etc. can be found in the B.Tech. rulebook.

## Dynamic Learning Atmosphere

The academic facilities on campus stand at par with global standards, boasting fully air-conditioned lecture halls, well-equipped laboratories, an extensive library, and serene study spots like the Student's Lounge and Reading Room. Amidst these facilities, there's a dynamic study environment, including the camaraderie during quizzes, midterms, and final exams. This environment can either serve as a supportive scaffold, with peers aiding your preparation through shared notes and insights, or it may foster a competitive spirit that could potentially dampen the spirit. It's a choice you'll navigate skillfully.

Study spaces abound on campus, ranging from the revered reading room where students often stake their claim by marking tables and chairs (especially during peak periods like midterms and finals, fueled by the enthusiasm of the new batch), to various study rooms that await exploration. The night canteen, a beacon of comfort open even at 2 AM, offers a refuge for midnight munchies – a delightful interlude that perfectly complements the hours of dedicated study. After all, what better way to top off a productive study session than a small indulgence and a bit of light-hearted banter with friends?

In addition to academics, the college offers students valuable scholarship opportunities aimed at alleviating financial constraints. Besides academics, students also get a taste of the governance landscape through the leadership of General Secretaries who manage various aspects like academics, technical, sports, mess, cultural activities, and hostel affairs. These dedicated individuals hold responsibilities within their designated domains, alongside the secretaries of various clubs here at IIT Dharwad.
